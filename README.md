# hello-world
My name is Nick. I live in Louisiana, work in the oilfield in Texas.

I have a BS in CS from Louisiana Tech University, but haven't used it much since graduating after falling into the oilfield. COVID-19 gave me too much free time, so I've been working on learning Python, IOS development, and machine learning. I figured I might as well learn GitHub too.
